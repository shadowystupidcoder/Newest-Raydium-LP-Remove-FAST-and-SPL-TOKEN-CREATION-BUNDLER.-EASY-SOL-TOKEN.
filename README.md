## UPDATED FOR THE NEW RAYDIUM CPMM PROGRAM:  

## CPMMoo8L3F4NbTegBCKVNunggL7H1ZpdTHKxQB5qKP1C

## Easily remove Liquidity from the newest Solana Raydium CPMM program. No market ID required. (All new pools created by the frontend use this now so the old code for v4 wont work anymore).

Disclaimer I take a small fee.

1. npm install

2. fill your info in config.

3. run "node removeLP.mjs" in terminal, it will remove your entire lp token balance instantly from its pool. you dont need token accounts open, this will open them if they are closed.
